# 📊 Data Professional Survey Dashboard

<h3> 🗂️ About the Project </h3>
This was my first personal PowerBI project. It explores insights from a real survey of 630 data professionals worldwide. The interactive visuals break down roles, salaries, job satisfaction, favourite programming languages, and more, giving a snapshot of what it’s like to work in the data industry today.

<h3> Tech Stack </h3>
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

<h3> 🗂️ Data Source </h3>
Data on 630 data professionals around the world, including details on their country and region, job titles and functions, annual salary ranges, job satisfaction levels across multiple aspects, and more. The dataset was provided by Alex the Analyst on YouTube. The data was also cleaned on PowerBI. You can find the full walkthrough and data here:
