# 📊 Data Professional Survey Dashboard

<h3> 🗂️ About the Project </h3>
This was my first personal PowerBI project. It explores insights from a real survey of 630 data professionals worldwide. The interactive visuals break down roles, salaries, job satisfaction, favourite programming languages, and more, giving a snapshot of what it’s like to work in the data industry today.

<h3> Tech Stack </h3>
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

<h3> 🗂️ Data Source </h3>
Data on 630 data professionals around the world, including details on their country and region, job titles and functions, annual salary ranges, job satisfaction levels across multiple aspects, and more. The dataset was provided by Alex the Analyst on YouTube. The data was also cleaned on PowerBI. You can find the full walkthrough and data here:

<h3> ✨ Highlights </h3>
🌍 Global Reach: The majority of respondents are from the United States, followed by India, United Kingdom, Canada, and Other. Other refers to cleaned data which groups countries outside of the option in the survey.

💵 Salary Trends: Data Scientists earn the most on average among the listed roles, while Analysts and Database Developers earn less in comparison. Students/Looking for Jobs naturally show the lowest average salary.

🐍 Popular Languages: Python dominates as the top programming language, which demonstrates it is a clear favourite among all data roles. R comes in second most common, especially among Data Analysts and Scientists. Other languages (C/C++, JavaScript, Java) have very low usage among this group.

🚪 Breaking In: 42.7% of respondents say it’s neither easy nor difficult. About 24.76% say it’s easy. A significant portion (21%) find it difficult. Very few see it as very easy or very difficult. This suggests that while many find it manageable to enter the field, barriers still exist for a notable group.

⚖️ Work & Pay: Average satisfaction is higher for work-life balance (5.7/10) than salary (4.3/10), showing many feel underpaid for the work they do.
